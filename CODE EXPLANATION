PROGRAM EXPLANATION:
 Unistd has all posix functions
sys/types has definitions for signed int and signed long, we need cuz pid_t data type is an signed integer
In the written program  the child process will output the sequence of numbers obtained from the algorithm as specified under the conditions of the Collatz conjecture.
Only the child process implements the collatz conjecture process.
int k is used to store the initial number from which the sequence starts
pid_t is used to store the process Id and related information but mainly process Id.

First we take the input from user. Here we use a do while loop to make sure the input>0

Execute the fork() system call. This creates a child process and returns the pid = 0 to child on succesfull creation. The Child process has its own copy of Program data.
The pid of parent process != 0. Hence it enters the else block. The function wait() is called. Wait() suspends all parent activities untill one of its child return/signals that its execution is over.

After wait() is called. We move to child process, where pid = 0. It enters if block and executes the algorithm. After finishing it displays the value of k stored in child process and returns/signals zero indicating the process is over.
Once the child process is done, the parent continues. It displays the value of k it has stored. Then terminates execution
